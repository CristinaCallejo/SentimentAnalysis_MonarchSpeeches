poor little fool,ricky nelson,"I used to play around with hearts
That hastened at my call
But when I met that little girl
I knew that I would fall

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)
(I was a fool, oh yeah)

She played around and teased me
With her carefree devil eyes
She'd hold me close and kiss me
But her heart was full of lies

Poor little fool, oh yeah
I was a fool, uh huh
(Oh oh, poor little fool)

patricia,perez prado and his orchestra,
splish splash,bobby darin,"Splish splash, I was taking a bath
Long about a Saturday night, yeah
Rub dub, just relaxin' in the tub
Thinkin' everything was alright

Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me, and I opened the door
And then a splish, splash, I jumped back in the bath
Well how was I to know there was a party going on

They was a-splishin' and a-splashin', reelin' with the feelin'
Movin' and a-groovin', rockin' and a-rollin', yeah

hard headed woman,elvis presley with the jordanaires,"Well a hard headed woman
A soft hearted man
Been the cause of trouble
Ever since the world began

Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of man

Adam told to Eve
Listen here to me
Don't you let me catch you
Messin' round that apple tree

Oh yeah, ever since the world began
A hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of man

when,kalin twins,"When, when you smile, when you smile at me
Well, well, I know our love will always be
When, when you kiss, when you kiss me right
I, I don't want to ever say good night

I need you
I want you near me
I love you, yes, I do
And I hope you hear me

When, when I say, when I say, ""Be mine""
